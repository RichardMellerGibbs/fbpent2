Web application for the Fiveboroughs Pentathlon club.
Built using the MEAN stack (angular 1) and bootstrap.
This is my first web site using this technology. It may need some imporvements here and there but I'm generally very happy with it.
I went to some trouble to set up the node routes such that they are easy to maintain.
This is an example of how to build a site with Jason web token authentication and a certain degree of content management.

The site can be accessed using the following URL http://www.5boroughspentathlon.co.uk
